A heap is a complete binary tree where:

Max-Heap: The value of a parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.

Min-Heap: The value of a parent node is less than or equal to the values of its children.

Complete binary tree: all levels fully filled except possibly the last, filled from left to right.

Usually implemented using arrays, not pointers.

For a node at index i (0-based):

Left child: 2*i + 1

Right child: 2*i + 2

Parent: (i-1)/2

Heap Operations:

insert	-	O(log n)
extractMax / extractMin	-	O(log n)
peek -	O(1)
Build heap from array -	O(n)


ADV. -
skip using pointers 
memory efficient

Heapify :-process of adjusting the subtree to follow the heap rules.
